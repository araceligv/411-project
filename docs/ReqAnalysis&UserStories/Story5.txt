Providing feedback 
As a user, I want to be able to provide feedback and make complaints regarding 
any bugs I encounter while using the app.

Happy Path:
Users will be able to locate an easily identifiable support section to lodge 
complaints. A list of categories will be available to select from, so that 
the user can get the best support possible. There is an option to provide 
feedback and get support. Support can be with regards to user account information, 
such as recovering a lost account. 

Unhappy Path:
The unhappy path is if a user can’t easily navigate through the application and lodge 
their complaint. Moreover, this may also occur if a user’s concerns are not properly 
addressed. Certain complaints may require customer service to engage with the user, 
and this should happen promptly. Holistic complaints such as improvements to the application 
should also be properly addressed so that users know that the engineering department is taking 
user feedback into account when designing new features.
