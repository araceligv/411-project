Idea #1:
Yelp api, covid api, recipe-nutrition api 

(recipe-nutrition api part) Once the user selects a restaurant, the menu of the selected restaurant will be popped up. 
Then, he/she can pick a dish from the menu. By typing in the name of the dish, the user can get more information regarding the dish. 
To be specific, we will use a recipe-nutrition api to match the most related recipe with the one the user desired and pull out the nutrition 
information from the recipe. On the web page, we can show users approximately how many calories will he/she consume by having such a dish. Also, if possible, we will also mark the recommended relatively 
healthier dishes to improve users dietary habits.


Idea #2:
Spotify API, speech-to-text api, various music APIs

We hope to create a project that allows a user to search for a song but with added functionality that uses their voice 
instead of explicitly their keyboard. Using the Spotify API and other various music APIs, we hope to create a project that allows 
users to retrieve desired information on any song they wish to search. With the abundance of information at our disposal with these
various free music APIs, we hope this application also provides a user a list of related songs compared to the one they searched for, 
and even have a feature that allows them to play a snippet of a song to hear a sample. The application will hopefully serve as a one stop shop for all audiophiles to enjoy.
