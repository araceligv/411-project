Idea #1:
Yelp api, covid api, recipe-nutrition api

To be specific, we will use a recipe-nutrition api to match the most related recipe with the one the user desired and pull out the nutrition information from the recipe. 
On the web page, we can show users approximately how many calories will he/she consume by having such a dish. Also, if possible, we will also mark the recommended relatively 
healthier dishes to improve users dietary habits.
