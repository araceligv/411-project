Registering	

    In order to use this application, a user must first be able to register with 3rd party authentication, 
primarily a music related service. This will then allow personalized information about the user to be 
associated with their account. This leads to the assumption that a user must first make an account with 
a 3rd party music service prior to using this application. If they attempt to login with an account that 
is not properly registered, they should be met with an error message.

    In order to register an account, they will be redirected to the 3rd partyâ€™s website that will allow them to 
enter their username and password. This tab should then close and redirect them to this application. A user 
should be able to login in a similar fashion. A user, despite who they are, will be directed to the same homepage. 
The page will be minimalist by design and contain several elements. The most significant being a broad search bar 
that takes up the majority of the page; this is where the user will be able to search for a variety of different 
pieces of music related information. On the upper-right hand corner of  the web page, the user can click on a few 
tabs that contain separate web pages that provide information personalized to them and their past use with the 3rd 
party web service and the application. If a user has a relatively new account with not much information to be displayed, 
a page should appear for each respective tab detailing this situation. A user can always provide feedback on the app in order 
to notify developers of any mishaps.
