Favoriting 

    This feature appears at the bottom of the song paster and is shaped 
like a heart icon. It allows users to click the heart and when clicked
the heart will turn red. The red heart indicates that you have added the song to favorites.

    The main purpose of adding a favorites feature is that users can keep 
the songs which they hear very often and like the most with them and don’t 
have to search them again and again.

    By adding a song to favorites, they will be added to a folder called 
favorites folder which keeps all the songs the user added to favorites, 
in the order of the date it was added. The user can play the songs from this 
playlist, play the entire playlist, unfavorite the song which will remove the song 
from the favorites. 

    It is easy to use and a very popular/preferred feature for user’s as 
it keeps their favorite songs at one place and provides them easy access to 
it. They can even edit the list to keep up with their changing preferences and trends.
