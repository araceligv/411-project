Searching	

    There should be a broad search bar that appears across the minimalist homepage, 
and on one of the corners of the search bar, a user can toggle between a variety of 
options to search: an artist, their songs, song lyrics, or concerts. The user has the 
option to either speak their search query by pressing an icon that will initiate speech 
recognition, or they could simply type their search in the search bar. 

    Upon this search query, they should be presented, on the same page, either a list of 
songs, artists, events that match their search query or a statement that describes a lack 
of song results. These results will be displayed in a list format that contains a couple of 
pieces of information related to a particular result/row in this list-like display. In order to 
have a more in-depth overview of a particular result/row, a user can click on the main title 
of the row in order to then be directed to a new page.
